The Identity Factory is a suite of smart contracts that together make a complete blockchain based identity solution.
Through the factory individuals can create identities for themselves, while event organizers/institutions etc. can create Souls, that are able to issue soulbound tokens (SBT) to the identity contracts.

## Identity

The Identity.sol contract is an ERC725 contract that is able to hold SBTs, and can contain the identity's owner's profile information.
